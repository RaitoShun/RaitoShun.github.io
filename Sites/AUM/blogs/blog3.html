          AUM — the eternal Universal mantra. It’s chanted during extended
          meditations because it’s very sound contains the entire universe.
          However, I believe there’s more to this sacred vibration that can
          profoundly change our lives.
          <br />
          <br />
          The most enlightened yogis tell us AUM is made up of the three
          fundamental components that form ALL human language: the “ah” sound,
          the “oh” sound, and the “mm” sound. Even though our tongues can mix
          and alter these three sounds into millions of words, these three
          sounds alone are the most intrinsic parts. Gurus also teach us that
          AUM represents the three stages of the universe: Birth, Life, and
          Death.
          <br />
          <br />
          The “ah” is the very first sound that babies make, regardless of their
          nationality. The “mm” sound represents the quantum vibrations of the
          universe after we pass away. And the “oh” sound is everything
          manifested in between. These truths are beautiful and enriching. Yogis
          and gurus have been teaching these esoteric mysteries for years, even
          though so much of the world has difficulty listening. But as I was
          meditating one day on the eternal mantra of AUM, I received a message
          from the universe that AUM meant something even more. “How can AUM
          help me and those I love today, right now?” I asked silently. I didn’t
          expect a response. However, as I sat there in the dark and in the
          silence, I received a message that AUM stood for a state of existence
          that our planet desperately needs right now: Awakened Ultimate
          Manifestation.
          <br />
          <br />
          This state of existence comes in three parts:
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Awakened</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Each one of us has the obligation to step out of the social paradigms
          and the matrix that surrounds us. We need to wake up from the hypnosis
          that our current world order has placed us in.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <h2>Ultimate</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Once awakened, we have the obligation to find who we are at the
          deepest core. We must peel back the layers and remove anything that
          comes from somewhere other than the eternal love of the Universe.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <h2>Manifestation</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Once we are awakened, and once we have learned who we truly are, we
          have the obligation to shine our light and share our gifts with the
          world. It is our duty as human beings on this planet to embody the
          spiritual truths we have come to share.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          I was stunned. It seemed so simple, yet so profound. Here, in the
          eternal word of AUM, which I have chanted for so many years was a new
          meaning directed specifically for this time and place in human
          history. Having received this message, I knew that it was my calling
          to share this truth with others and help people walk through this
          process. That’s why you’re reading these words right now. I want to
          help each person on this amazing, spiritual journey, wherever they are
          at. Using the gifts of the Spirit which God has given me–and which you
          can receive too–we can raise the collective consciousness of our
          planet and bring it back into balance through healing. There’s so much
          we can do together.
