        <p>
          Are you trying to manifest something in your life and feel like
          nothing’s happening? Do you think you’re doing something wrong? Are
          you starting to believe that manifestation does not work after all?
        </p>
        <p>
          The first thing you should know is that it’s alright to feel this way.
          Frustration is a normal human emotion. Try to let it come and go
          without letting it make you feel disillusioned. Trust the process even
          if you don’t have a lot of evidence for it yet. With that said, here
          are three ways that help you boost your manifestation:
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <h2>1. Act as though you already have it</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          You may have heard that manifestation requires that you think you
          already have what you want. However, thinking alone will not help you
          get it. Only thinking about it shows that you don’t have enough
          conviction, both to yourself and the Universe. Take action to prove
          your conviction for manifesting what you desire. For example, you want
          to manifest your dream vacation to the Bora Bora island. If your
          approach is only to dream about the blue sea there in your free time,
          you might not be successful at manifesting the vacation. A good
          approach will involve taking action as if you’re just about to leave
          for the vacation. Go through different websites to learn more about
          the island. Search for the hotel you would book. Take out the clothes
          you would wear. Make an itinerary. Plan out everything you would do.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <h2>2. Work on Yourself</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Oprah has famously said: “Luck is preparation meeting the moment of
          opportunity. There is no luck without you being prepared to handle
          that moment of opportunity.” If you want to manifest something you
          want, you have to be ready to receive it. You have to become the kind
          of person that has what you want in their life. Think about the type
          of person who would travel to the Bora Bora island. A person who would
          go on a vacation like that likes adventure and new experiences. They
          are curious about different cultures. They enjoy being out in nature.
          Now think if you are that kind of person. Do you seek adventure and
          new experiences? Do you spend time learning about new cultures or out
          in nature? If you only dream about doing these things one day, it will
          be hard to manifest them in your life. Work on yourself so that you
          will be able to receive what you want when the opportunity arises.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <h2>3. Eliminate doubt</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          The fastest way to kill your dreams is to doubt that they will come
          true. Doubt is also the sneaky reason that may be standing in your
          path towards manifesting what you want. Faith is the foundation for
          manifestation. If you don’t have faith, your efforts will not result
          in the outcome you want. It is not always easy to prevent doubts from
          creeping in. That’s why you have to be on your guard. Avoid listening
          to arguments or rationalizations against what you want to manifest.
          Have faith. Trust the process. The Universe will show up for you.
